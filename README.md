# Mars_html_challenge

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files, that display the skills taught during class to complete successful
HTML web scrapes. The code in Part 1 displays the ability to remove and store in a list the titles and brief descriptions
of each article listed on the web page of interest. Part 2 displays the capability of python to scrape a table from a web page
using both Splinter and Pandas read_html; however, all analyses were completed using the Splint/BeautifulSoup table. Pandas was
only used for cross referencing purposes.
